Battle of PyThonia

Battle of PyThonia is a text-based RPG written in Python where you fight enemies, level up, unlock skills, and survive epic battles.
The game was built from scratch to explore game design, AI, and RPG mechanics — all inside the terminal.


Features

Turn-based combat system against Goblins, Skeletons, Orcs, and Dragons.

Player classes: Hero, Tank, or Mage, each with unique abilities.

Special skills: Shield Block, Fireball, Phase Shift, Heal, Rage Attack, and more.

Enemy AI that blocks, smashes, and unleashes special skills.

Critical hits, buffs, and charge attacks for strategic combat.

Inventory system with potions for health, mana, and speed.

Leveling system with EXP, scaling stats, and new skills.

Skill cooldowns with a timed recharge system.

Replayable battles with random enemies and scaling difficulty.

Gameplay Preview

When the game starts, you pick a player, select an enemy, and choose your skills. Combat is turn-based with tactical choices.
